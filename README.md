# CATS: Computer science house Automated Tube System

CATS is an open source automated [pneumatic tube system][1] developed for the
Computer Science House at RIT.

## Wait, what is it?

A pneumatic tube system (come on, there was a Wikipedia link like 1 sentence
ago!) is a series of tubes that can move physical packages around using a
vacuum. These packages must match certain dimensions to be able to move through
the tubes.

Walk up to one of the endpoints of the system, grab an empty capsule and put
something inside of it, press the button for where you want it to go, wait for
the LED to say the system is ready, put the capsule in the tube.

Inspired by and based on the [c3 Seidenstrasse][2] that I saw in operation at
[32c3][3], with some improvements.

## Why would you build this?

Uhh, because it's cool? Also once this exists building services on top of it
would be cool projects for other members (like drink integration).

## What's this repo?

This repo is comprised of instructions for how to build the system, operator's
notes for for maintaining and running this system, 3D models to be printed that
are used in building the system, code that runs on arduinos, and a parts list
used to build the system.

## What's the status of all of this?

Incomplete. Come back later.
